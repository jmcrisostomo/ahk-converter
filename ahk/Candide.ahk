Candide[8] := "of Thunder-ten-tronckh, lived a youth whom Nature had endowed with"
Candide[9] := "a most sweet disposition. His face was the true index of his mind. He"
Candide[10] := "had a solid judgment joined to the most unaffected simplicity; and"
Candide[11] := "hence, I presume, he had his name of Candide. The old servants of the"

Candide[13] := "very good sort of a gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young"

Candide[18] := "The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for"
Candide[19] := "his castle had not only a gate, but even windows, and his great hall was"
Candide[20] := "hung with tapestry. He used to hunt with his mastiffs and spaniels"
Candide[21] := "instead of greyhounds; his groom served him for huntsman; and the"
Candide[22] := "parson of the parish officiated as his grand almoner. He was called ""My"

Candide[24] := "at it."
Candide[25] := "My Lady Baroness, who weighed three hundred and fifty pounds,"
Candide[26] := "consequently was a person of no small consideration; and then she did"
Candide[27] := "the honors of the house with a dignity that commanded universal"

Candide[29] := "comely, plump, and desirable. The Baron's son seemed to be a youth in"
Candide[30] := "every respect worthy of the father he sprung from. Pangloss, the"

Candide[33] := "Master Pangloss taught the metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology.He could prove to admiration that there is no effect without a"

Candide[68] := "day, as they were rising from dinner, Cunegund and Candide slipped"
Candide[69] := "behind the screen. The miss dropped her handkerchief, the young man"
Candide[70] := "picked it up. She innocently took hold of his hand, and he as innocently"
Candide[71] := "kissed hers with a warmth, a sensibility, a grace-all very particular;"
Candide[72] := "their lips met; their eyes sparkled; their knees trembled; their hands"

Candide[74] := "and, without hesitation, saluted Candide with some notable kicks on the"

Candide[84] := "melancholy look towards the magnificent castle, where dwelt the fairest"

Candide[86] := "heartbroken, and supperless. The snow fell in great flakes, and, in the"

Candide[88] := "made shift to crawl to the next town, which was called Wald-berghofftrarbkdikdorff, without a penny in his pocket, and half dead with"

Candide[173] := "bullets swept away, out of the best of all possible worlds, nine or ten"
